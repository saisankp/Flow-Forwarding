# Flow-Forwarding
A replacement for IPv4 or IPv6 that forwards payloads based on a collection of strings that identify the source and destination of traffic. The forwarding
information will be kept in forwarding tables located at the individual network elements and the content of
these tables will be controlled by a central controller.
